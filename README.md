- 👋 Hi, I’m @jmharris2024
- 👀 I’m interested in learning new things. I am currently working in customer service, as a GSA customer relations specialist. This job has exposed me to many things and created a new out of the box way of thinking for me....
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about cybersecurity and data analytics. I'm also currently in the process of learning Japanese and Korean. I've discovered a new passion for life and I don't want to waste any time wondering what if when I can learn new things every day.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that might help with data analytics or anything related to networking, and cyberscurity.
- 📫 How to reach me I'll wait to tell this information.
- 😄 Pronouns: she, her
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm a huge gamer. Bayonetta 1,2 and 3 are my all time favorite series. After final fantasy and the tales series. I love a good RPG with nice spell animations. Ice cream is my comfort food..or food in general is comforting lol.
